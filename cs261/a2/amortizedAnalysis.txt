1. 16 push operations -> 16 cost units.
   32 push operations -> 56 cost units.
   big-oh complexity for push -> O(1+).

2. 16 push operations -> 60 cost units.
   32 push operations -> 260 cost units.
   big-oh complexity for push -> O(n).

3. Push onto the stack until it fills to its capacity and doubles its size. Pop a value off which will make it half its size due to its capacity being less than 1/2 full. Repeat.
I would adjust the shrinking policy so that the stack would half its size when it's 1/4 full or less.
